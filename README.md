App based on [ReCoders Challenge](https://github.com/cristobalgvera/tindet-pet/blob/main/extras/ReCoders%20Challenge%20-%20Full%20Stack%20Java.pdf).

## Languages and technologies used

### Backend

- Java 15.
- Spring Boot 2.4.0.
- PostgreSQL 13.

### Frontend

- TypeScript 4.0.
- React 17.0.1.

## To test it

Both, backend and frontend, needs to be running, so:

### Backend

Assuming you have Java and Gradle installed...

``` powershell
cd tinder-pet-api
gradle bootRun
```

Also you can run the API with whatever Spring run method you want, i.e.: IDE-based method.

### Frontend

Assuming you have npm installed...

``` powershell
cd tinder-pet-web
npm i

```
